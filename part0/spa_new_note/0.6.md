Here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server
    
    Note right of browser: User types 'hello world' in the input field with name 'note' and clicks on the submit button
    
    Note right of browser: The callback set to 'onsubmit' of the form gets executed. It adds the note to the list on the browser and initiates an ajax call to update the backend
    
    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa with payload {"content":"hello world","date":"2023-02-16T09:55:44.267Z"}
    activate server    
    server-->>browser: application/json response with status 201, body {"message":"note created"}
    deactivate server
    
    Note left of server: Next time if https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa is requested by the browser the newly added item shows up in the list
```
